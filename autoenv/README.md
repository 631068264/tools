Autoenv: Directory-based Environments
======================================

Magic per-project shell environments. Very pretentious.

What is it?
-----------

If a directory contains a ``.env`` file, it will automatically be executed
when you ``cd`` into it.

This is great for...

- auto-activating virtualenvs

Install
-------
You can put the **activate.sh** anywhere if you like. Then put `source your/path/activate.sh` into **.zshrc**
